What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for JShell class and File class.
    - designed the File class and MakeDirectory class. 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - write the code for File class and MakeDirectory command.
    - start designing and writing code for ChangeDirectory command.
    - Work on the shell to have it continously prompt the user for input. 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need Path class and Directory class done before writing code for MakeDirectory and ChangeDirectory commands.
    - Need structure of the shell finalized before working on the shell prompter.
