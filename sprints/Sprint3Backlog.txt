Sprint 3 Backlog.
November 4 to November 10

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to continuously enter commands into the shell until I exit so that I can execute operations.
b) As a user, I want to be able to quit the program so that I can leave safely.
c) As a user, I want to display content of a file on the shell so that I can check the content of that file.
d) As a user, I want to display the content of multiple files one after another on the shell so that I can check the content of multiple files at the same time.
e) As a user, I want to be able to see the documentation for a command so that I can understand how to use that command.
f) As a user, I want to be able to print the contents of my current directory so that I can see the files in the current directory.
g) As a user, I want to be able to print the contents of a directory whose path I provide so that I can see the files inside that directory.
h) As a user, I want to be able to have the path of a specified file returned so that I can see if that file exists.
